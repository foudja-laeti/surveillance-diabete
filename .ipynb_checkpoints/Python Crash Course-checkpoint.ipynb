    "In Jupyter Notebooks, to quickly run a piece of code contained in a cell, click inside the cell and press Shift+Enter. Some code takes longer to run; you can tell when code is running by checking the circle in the top right, next to where it says 'Python 3 (ipykernel)' or something of the sort. If the circle is shaded in, code is running, and when it becomes transparent again, the code has run. Don't worry if you don't see the circle become shaded in - some code runs so fast that we can't quite catch it!\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code in Jupyter Notebooks, you can either press the run button in the top left bar of tools, or you can use the keyboard shortcut shift+enter. I'll use this a lot in the course, so you may not be able to see me actually hitting run on the code. I encourage you to use it too - it saves lots of time!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the files that aren't labeled 'Guided Notes,' you'll see all the code I'm typing out in the lecture. I'd like you to follow along inside the guided notes files and consult the other files if you get lost or encounter errors. Additionally, there will be exercises for you to complete in the guided notes files after certain lectures. There is an nswer key for these exercises in a separate notebook. Note that if you type something different into a non-guided-notes file cell, then hit run, the output will be erased, and it won't be recoverable. If for some reason you want to change the code in a non-guided-notes file, make sure you don't need the old output anymore!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after you run the notebook app files for the first time, you'll see 'app.py' and 'keyapp.py' pop up in your Jupyter Folder for the course, if they aren't already there. For the app lectures, you can either work in there or in the corresponding notebook file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some extra info about Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "You run code cell by cell, so when you hit run on cell A, even if you've deleted everything in cell B, it doesn't reset. All the variables are still saved. This is sometimes useful, but can also lead to errors if you aren't mindful of the fact that just deleting code doesn't delete anything you've created/defined from the computer's memory. If you truly want to reset a variable, write 'variable = 0' or something of the like in a new cell and run that. (Don't worry if you don't know what a variable is yet and this is going over your head - all will be explained momentarily!)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already understand print statements, variables, lists, arrays, indexing, For loops, imports, and functions, feel free to skim or skip everything else in the notebook. If not, follow along, do the exercises (they won't take long, I promise), and then I'll see you in the course!"
